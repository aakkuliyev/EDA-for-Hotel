It lasted two more full days, and she conveniently had the next day off so we could not address it with her. Also, the check-in process was awful as they made us wait three hours in the hot and humid conditions for our room. However, the restaurants (and their staff) are excellent. I can't say enough about the staff at Blue, as they were extremely friendly and always went out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face. The food at all three dinner restaurants (as well as Chil for lunch) was very good, and service was mostly great throughout. Our room itself was very clean, and the pool areas are fantastic. Also, room service was very fast and was also delicious. It was a shame that the front desk dropped the ball on so many occasions because it really could have been an awesome trip, but it was unfortunately blemished by poor customer service on the front end.",Servicio excepcional,Moncho

Ofrecen servicio de bebidas y alimentos en la playa y efectivamente existe, pero la persona encargada pasa por la playa cada hora. No tienen servicio de traslado areopuerto-hotel-aeropuerto, hay que contratarlo aparte y el hotel no recomienda a nadie especifico.

FYI, the outdoor pool is open until 11 p.m. poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls, but if you have toddlers/young children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party, you may want to request a room on another side of the hotel--pool party noise kept us up late the first night (and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we weren't worn out from traveling!) Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!)

I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround. Closer to town, it has a few stores within walking distance.",Better Choices,Richard

Upon arrival there was 3 people in front of us in line. All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room. In my opinion anyone considering this hotel for your vacation should just keep looking.,Web pics are fake! Run away!,melissa

I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either.

I wasn't impressed by the location as the main entrance is off a rather run down street. The back was nicer as it was on the marina but it was a fairly long, hot walk to all the major attractions. My room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently updated. The view was grim but I didn't pay for a sea view so I was stuck looking at concrete. I like to work out first thing in the morning but I couldn't use the tiny gym because it was out by the pool and didn't open until 10am and breakfast (which I'd paid for in my room rate) was served 7.30-10.30 so time was not on my side. The breakfast was nice but I would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu. The view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best things about the hotel. I'm very glad I wasn't there high season as the hotel is literally right beside Tito's a very popular nightclub. I did hear some noise a couple of times in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be people walking by the back of the hotel so it didn't last long. The pool was nice- lots of loungers. The staff were fairly friendly on the whole. I had room service once and it was of good quality. I didn't like the 4.50 service charge to bring it to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip. They charge for practically everything. No water in room on arrival and I was thirsty!!",Didn't quite live up to price tag,traveler

We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well. It's about 40 minute walk to the city centre and it's not close to the beaches either. Unfortunately, I don't have anything nice to say about this hotel.",Don't deserve 5 star rating!,Judy

There is a small selection of bar meals which was very good. The cost of food and drinks is very reasonable considering the surroundings and service. We never ate dinner in the main restaurant but the breakfast had an excellent choice everything from full cooked English to fresh fruit, natural local yoghurt and lots of cereals or pastries. The Cava on ice was a nice touch. The rooms are modern but with an old world charm, from the1930s () marble style bathrooms to solid wood writing desks and comfortable arm chairs. Comfortable beds, plenty of hot water and wifi in the rooms. Overall the decor and furnishing in this hotel speaks of solid old fashioned quality in a modern well-run establishment. Sure if you look at your feet as you walk, you will see the odd threadbare carpet in the corridors but it completely fits with the feel of a well-loved lived in country mansion that isn polished from top to bottom daily.
